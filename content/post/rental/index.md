### Bad experience

1. Don't trust the landload compeletely. Before getting the `key` and clean house, don't pay anything.
    - Confirm which room, which floor.
2. Check the `door`, make sure it won't be locked by itself.
3. Make sure the time to moving the `luggage`, be clear at which day and hour.
    - If it changes, remind `what was discussed` before and ask why.
    - Confirm 10 minutes `early` if it is not clear at time.
4. For the urgent case, make a `call`, don't believe the messages.

### Future alarm

1. Check the staff:
    - washing machine, dry machine
    - air condition
