* Make a plan for review and study
* In the final class: Which part is `important`, which part is `tricky`
* Organize sudy materials
* Study group: everybody wants to study with sb
* Rehearse your learning: talk or teach to someone else
* Practice the exam and test yourself ( Time limition; without acess to solution)
* Have your model: keep it! some people told you skip someone you good at? NO! do not do it in the exam

### During Exam
* Confident, but prepared! Don't overestimate yourself
* Double check when and where
* Try to get more info: how long, how many questions; Copies of past exams

1. Look through the questions, confirm it's clear
2. Writing all the thing down in your brain after you look at this papers. to avoid you forget them.
3. Pick the best answers: circle the key info extrem words;
4. Some questions you do not know; ignore them: most points are lost in something you know; Get more points in the exam; Rather than loss less points
5. Don't miss the task! concept they know all of them but miss the task

* When you review: Go for your first answer: if you have proves that you are wrong, change it; otherwise no!!

### After Example: learn from exam
* why I loss the point? Read question wrong or miss the key word?
* which undersatnding level was required? Recognize it? Know it? Understand it? Use it?
* Did you a have a deep enough understanding of the materials?
